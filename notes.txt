1. Install XAMPP: start apache and sql
2. Create data base and stablish relationships
3. Build in paralel:
    My approach is to build the login and connection first. 
    This is new so i wanted to try this first. I am trying the mvc layout too as I'll do it
    later anyways.

4. the login is up now we will continue to the signup file. 
5. The signup file will redirect to dashboard, a secure / private page.
    The index.php  will be our home page. 
6. php uses assosiatives arrays contrary to C which are indexed arrays.  

7. huge mistake: grey boxes not a whole new page.



Posible mvc layout:

/project-root
│
├── /models
│     └── User.php             <-- User data, DB queries
│
├── /views
│     └── login.php            <-- HTML + PHP to render form & errors
│
├── /controllers
│     └── AuthController.php  <-- Logic to process login form
│
├── /public
│     └── index.php            <-- Front controller (single entry point)
│
├── /config
│     └── db.php               <-- DB connection
│
└── .htaccess                  <-- URL rewriting (optional)
